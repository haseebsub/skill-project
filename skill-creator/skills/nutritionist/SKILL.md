## Macronutrient Fundamentals

### Carbohydrates vs Proteins: Key Differences

#### Carbohydrates
**Primary Function:** Quick energy source
- **Calories per gram:** 4 calories
- **Main types:** Simple (sugars) and complex (starches, fiber)
- **Best sources:** Whole grains, fruits, vegetables, legumes
- **Digestion speed:** Fast to moderate
- **Storage:** Glycogen in liver and muscles

**When to Focus on Carbs:**
- High-intensity exercise
- Post-workout recovery
- Brain function and concentration
- Daily energy needs

#### Proteins
**Primary Function:** Tissue building and repair
- **Calories per gram:** 4 calories
- **Main types:** Complete (all essential amino acids) and incomplete
- **Best sources:** Meat, fish, eggs, dairy, legumes, nuts
- **Digestion speed:** Slow
- **Storage:** Not stored, excess converted to energy or fat

**When to Focus on Protein:**
- Muscle building and repair
- Satiety and weight management
- Immune function
- Hormone and enzyme production

### Daily Requirements

#### Carbohydrates
- **General health:** 45-65% of total calories
- **Active individuals:** 5-7g per kg bodyweight
- **Endurance athletes:** 7-12g per kg bodyweight
- **Low-carb diets:** 20-50g per day (therapeutic)

#### Proteins
- **General health:** 0.8g per kg bodyweight
- **Active individuals:** 1.2-1.6g per kg bodyweight
- **Muscle building:** 1.6-2.2g per kg bodyweight
- **Weight loss:** 1.6-2.6g per kg bodyweight

## Meal Planning Strategies

### Daily Meal Structure

#### Balanced Plate Method
- **1/2 plate:** Non-starchy vegetables
- **1/4 plate:** Lean protein
- **1/4 plate:** Complex carbohydrates
- **Add:** Healthy fats and fruits

#### Timing Considerations
- **Breakfast:** Balanced meal within 1-2 hours of waking
- **Pre-workout:** Carbs + light protein (1-3 hours before)
- **Post-workout:** Protein + carbs (within 2 hours)
- **Dinner:** Protein + vegetables, lighter on carbs

### Portion Control

#### Hand Portion Guide
- **Protein:** Palm-sized portion
- **Carbohydrates:** Fist-sized portion
- **Vegetables:** Two cupped hands
- **Fats:** Thumb-sized portion
- **Fruits:** One cupped hand

#### Calorie Density Awareness
- **Low density:** Vegetables, fruits (few calories per volume)
- **Medium density:** Lean proteins, whole grains
- **High density:** Fats, oils, sweets (many calories per volume)

## Special Dietary Considerations

### Weight Management

#### For Weight Loss
- Create 500-calorie deficit per day
- Focus on protein for satiety (1.6-2.2g/kg)
- Choose complex carbs over simple sugars
- Increase fiber intake (25-35g/day)

#### For Weight Gain
- Create 500-calorie surplus per day
- Distribute extra calories across all macros
- Focus on nutrient-dense foods
- Consider meal frequency (5-6 smaller meals)

### Activity-Based Nutrition

#### Sedentary Lifestyle
- Focus on nutrient density over quantity
- Moderate carbohydrate intake
- Adequate protein for maintenance
- Emphasis on fruits, vegetables, whole grains

#### Active Lifestyle
- Higher total calorie needs
- Increased carbohydrate intake for energy
- Higher protein for recovery
- Hydration is crucial

#### Athletic Performance
- Sport-specific nutrition planning
- Timing of nutrient intake
- Electrolyte replacement strategies
- Recovery nutrition protocols

## Food Quality and Choices

### Carbohydrate Sources

#### Best Choices (Complex Carbs)
- Whole grains: Brown rice, quinoa, oats
