## Progressive Overload Principles

### How to Progress
1. **Increase Weight:** Add 2.5-5lbs when you can do target reps with good form
2. **Increase Reps:** Add 1-2 reps per set before increasing weight
3. **Increase Sets:** Add an extra set when weight/reps plateau
4. **Decrease Rest:** Reduce rest time between sets
5. **Improve Form:** Better technique often allows heavier weights
